## Who I Am

I've been a programmer since I was 12 and an entrepreneur since I was 18, running two of my own businesses before joining Myplanet in 2007.  I'm a Civil Engineer by education but hold a B.Sc in Computer Science.   I still build bridges, but not in the way I expected. :)  I am a passionate individual with a lot of integrity.  I take pride in my work and what I produce.  I am always learning and always looking for the next challenge.  Myplanet has always embraced the inner innovator and entrepreneur of all of its Myplaneteers and it has allowed me to thrive as an individual as well as a member of a team.

## What I do

I do a lot of different things.  I spend about half my time at the intersection of technology and operations: resolving organizational wide obstacles or helping the company move forward on various initiatives.  Whether it be maintaining or improving our infrastructure, rolling out new productivity apps or integrating our technical services, my focus is on keeping our team happy, productive and unblocked.  The other half of my time, I'm an engineer on our support team.  I assess and resolve critical issues for our enterprise clients, conduct production code pushes, regression testing and new feature launches.
