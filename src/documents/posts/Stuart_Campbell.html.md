## Who I Am

My name is Stuart Alan Campbell, the grand optimist, who hopes to play a leading role in making this world a better place through computing technology. My time outside of software is spent singing, writing music, playing sports, and eating good food with family and friends.

## What I do

At Myplanet, I am tasked with digging deep into finding opportunities for potential clients to become more successful through having a world-class digital presence. I digest product, company, and industry information, and produce insightful comments that support our business development team.
