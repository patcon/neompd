## Who I Am

A Vancouver based geek who enjoys both worlds or design and development. As well as the world of video games, gadgets and boring exercises.

## What I do

 The core focus of my daily duties is around front-end development but I also touch upon anything from interaction design to backend development. I'm also responsible for drink a lot of coffee everyday.
