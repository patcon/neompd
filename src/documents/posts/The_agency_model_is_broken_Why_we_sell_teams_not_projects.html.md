In the typical model for project work at a digital agency, a contract would lay out the scope of work (often in considerable depth), the cost per deliverable, and the expected delivery date.

It's not difficult to see where this model is fundamentally broken. Disputes bubble up over what's in scope ("You told us we were getting iconography!" "Yes, but not an infinite amount"), when it's supposed to be done ("You said you'd deliver this list of 50 things by March 5th!" "Yes, but you added ten NEW things."), and how closely the scope is actually followed ("You wrote here that we would be getting an intro page with a sexy animation" "Yes, but it had a 98% bounce rate")

The typical solution to such problems is to implement agile: Focus on user goals by maintaining a backlog of "user stories"; commit to delivering small, defined chunks of potentially shippable work; and prioritize on a frequent basis by moving items up and down the backlog or by swapping them in or out.

But rolling out agile (REAL agile, not half-assed agile) is still only a half-solution, no matter how perfectly executed. Sure, it's now much easier to adapt to changing requirements and effectively prioritize work, but if you're working to a fixed-scope, fixed-budget, fixed-time contract, you're not practicing agile. You're practicing mini-waterfall.

We made the classic mistakes. After over a year of improving our practice of agile to the point where we were seeing real results (Scrum, in particular), we were still signing fixed-price, fixed-scope contracts. It was a monumental culture clash that was bad for us and bad for our clients.

When we finally decided to reflect our practice in our contracts in spite of our reservations, things went better than expected. Clients got the certainty of working with a team whose members had found a groove, had worked on a similar project before, and had gotten pretty good at estimating their actual work output. We didn't promise that we'd deliver on a fixed set of requirements, but it didn't matter - clients thought of us as an extension of their internal teams with a level of expertise it takes a long time to perfect.

We now introduce prospective clients to the team they'll likely be working with from day one. This team has the skills we believe necessary to meet the clients' needs in their entirety, from design through QA (excluding a few specialists who tend to work across teams). And in the parlance of high-performance teams, they have already progressed through the necessary but messy process of team forming and storming. In arriving at "norming", they understand each member's work style and how to accommodate it. Non-productive team members or mis-hires are identified and either moved to another team or let go.

That’s all great, but a waterfall project could give you a dedicated team too. What's really different? 
Rather than delivering the same old trusty project estimate, we offer a rather unusual promise: As a client, you will receive the undivided output of one or more appropriately skilled teams for a period of X weeks. During that time, the team will produce work that satisfies an agreed-upon set of user goals and business needs. While we cannot guarantee that we will satisfy each goal to a rigid set of requirements (for example, an interactive server configurator might be implemented as a simple drop-down list as time and priority dictates), we guarantee that we will satisfy each of these goals a high-quality way. Furthermore, we remain flexible enough to allow new information (from stakeholders, users, or some other source) to alter the direction we take as the project progresses. 

In a fixed amount of time and for a fixed amount of budget, clients receive a product that satisfies both user needs and business goals. We call it the "Minimum Desirable Product", and what we deliver can serve as a baseline for many more iterations throughout the product or platform's life cycle.

Admittedly, it can be a hard sell. There is a lack of context and experience when it comes to working within such a model, and sometimes it can make executives a little nervous (they've all been badly burned at some point or another). But regardless of where they begin, clients inevitably come to view it as a refreshingly honest and straightforward method of building a really great user experience and, subsequently, a valuable and usable product.

In the end, we just want to build great products. Selling teams might not be the only way, but it's the best way we've found.
