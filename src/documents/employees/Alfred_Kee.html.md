## Who I Am

Alfred comes from a diverse career in IT, having worked at two startups, an ERP software company and most recently a lengthy career at a Big-4 accounting firm.  Born and raised on the West Coast, his career has brought him to many cities of the world including living and working from offices in NYC, London, Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong.  He lived in Amsterdam for three years and has finally settled in the city with the most loyal NHL hockey fans in the world.  He once tried to escape IT by taking a year of culinary arts training.  Instead of becoming a celebrity chef, his skills are put to work on gourmet meals fit for a foodie at home served to family and friends.  One little known fact about Alfred is that he once won an amateur salsa competition with his now wife, and had a brief stint as a semi-professional salsa dancer both teaching and performing in his spare time.
