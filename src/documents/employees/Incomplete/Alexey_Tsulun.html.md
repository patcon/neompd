## Who I Am

Hey! I am Aleksey, I'm working remotely from Chernihiv, Ukraine. Computers became my hobby in childhood. I have M. S. in Computer Science from Chernihiv State Technology University. I've been working for Myplanet since 2012. In my free time I enjoy reading sci-fi books, learning history and languages.

## What I do

At Myplanet I work as a Drupal developer in Strategy and Support Group. I enjoy facing challenges, learning new technologies especially related to Javascript.
