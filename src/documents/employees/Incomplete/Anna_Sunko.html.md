## Who I Am

 I am Anna. I have been working for Myplanet remotely from Ukraine since 2012. I have a M.S. in Computer Science from Chernihiv State Technology University. I taught FPGA and C++ programming courses there from 2009 to 2010. Since that time I've been working as a Drupal developer.

## What I do

As a member of Strategy and Support Group I participate in developing new projects and maintaining existing ones. I enjoy doing research on complex issues and sharing knowledge across the team.
